	\section{Introduction}
	\label{section:intro}
	The goal of this project is to implement a text generator based on Long 
	Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
	
	\section{Preprocessing}
	\label{section:preprocessing}
	First of all, the book \textit{The Count of Monte Cristo} has been  
	downloaded in plain English text from Project Gutenberg.
	
	The first operation performed consists in the conversion to lower case of 
	all the text characters. Afterwards, a simple analysis of the data was 
	performed.
	
	The book contains about 2.65 million characters and in total there are 
	$111$ unique characters. The character list is displayed in Figure 
	\ref{fig:initial}, and it can be seen that the book contains English 
	letters, number, punctuation, symbols and Greek letters.
	
	\begin{figure}[htb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{initial.png}	
		\caption{Unique characters in \textit{The Count of Monte Cristo}}
		\label{fig:initial}
	\end{figure}

 	In order to train the network, it is necessary to map the text strings to a 
 	numerical representation. First of all,	the number of unique characters 
 	were counted as well as the absolute and relative frequencies. Hence, two 
 	dictionaries that act as lookup tables are created: one mapping characters 
 	to integers, and the other integers to characters. This will be crucial for 
 	the creation of a one-hot encoding.
 	
 	In Table \ref{tab:statistics} are presented the $20$ most frequent 
 	characters, with the corresponding encodings and frequencies.

		characters}
		\label{tab:statistics}
	\end{figure}

	\bigskip
	Soon after, training examples and targets were created. The input examples 
	correspond to a sequence of characters, while the target of each character 
	corresponds to the following character in the original sequence. In this 
	way, there is no target for the last element of the sequence.
	
	\section{Truncated backpropagation through time}
	\label{section:backpropagation}
	
	Given a very long sequence, it is impossible to feed it entirely and 
	then compute the backpropagation. Instead, it is possible to divide the 
	sequence into $n$ blocks and each block in $m$ subsequences which contain a 
	fixed number of characters of the text.\bigskip
	
	The $i\mathrm{-th}$ batch is created taking the $i\mathrm{-th}$ subsequence 
	from each block and computing the backpropagation on it. In this way, each 
	batch has multiple subsequences and the computations are more efficient.
	
	This approach enables us to pass the output state of a batch as input state 
	of the next batch. The state is reset to zero at the beginning of each 
	epoch.\bigskip
	
	In the experiment that will be presented have been used 16 blocks with 
	subsequences of size 256. 
	To ensure that all batches have sequences of the same length, before 
	creating the batches, the text is padded in such a way that sequences that 
	are shorter than 256 are filled with 0 at the end, thus avoiding to 
	truncate them.
	
	A mask containing the index of the valid characters is created in order to 
	compute the loss.
	
	\section{Network}
	\label{section:network}
	
	The model implemented is composed of a MultiRNNCell with two LSTMCells each 
	containing 256 units, following by a softmax output layer with $k$ units, 
	which correspond to the number of unique characters (one-hot encoding), in 
	this case 111.
	
	Table \ref{tab:model0} summarises the architecture of the network used in 
	the first experiment.	
	\begin{figure}[htb]
		\centering
		
		\begin{tabular}{ccc}
			\toprule
			\textbf{LSTMCell1} & \textbf{LSTMCell2} & \textbf{softmax} \\
			\midrule
			256 & 256 & 111\\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\captionof{table}{Network architecture}
		\label{tab:model0}
	\end{figure}

	\section{Evolution of the training loss function}
	\label{section:loss}

	The training would take 5 epochs and Adam is used as optimiser with a 
	learning rate of $10^2$. As loss function, the Softmax Cross Entropy with 
	Logits is used since the problem can be treated as a classification one.
	
	All the models were implemented using TensorFlow and trained on an NVIDIA 
	Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB GPU.
	
	The training loss of this experiment is shown in Figure 
	\ref{fig:model0-loss}.
	
	\begin{figure}[htb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{../src/out/initial/img/loss.pdf}	
		\caption{Training loss}
		\label{fig:model0-loss}
	\end{figure}

	The training loss at the end of the last epoch is 1.32.
	It is clearly visible that the training loss is still decreasing, so in a
	further modification of the model, presented in Section 
	\ref{section:improvement}, will be analysed the possibility of 
	increasing the number of training epochs in order to improve the results.

	\section{Generate and document 20 sequences}
	After training the model, in order to evaluate the network, 20 sequences 
	composed of 256 characters are generated.\bigskip
	
	The procedure of generation of a sequence starts by choosing an initial 
	character randomly, based on the relative frequencies presented in Section 
	\ref{section:preprocessing}.
	
	After that, the prediction distribution of the next character is given 
	using the initial character and the state of the network. In order to 
	calculate the index of the predicted character, a categorical distribution 
	is used. 
	
	The predicted character is used as the following input of the model along 
	with the previous hidden state.\bigskip

	Even if the sentences obtained have no real meaning, most of the generated 
	characters compose existing English words. In fact, only $20\%$ of the 
	words generated don't exist, that is a result quite promising.
	
	The sentences often present a common structure that is to put the direct 
	speeches in quotation marks.
	
	Unfortunately, many of the phrases reported present numerous new lines 
	because of the lack of preprocessing of the text.	
	
	\section{Improvement of the model}
	\label{section:improvement}
	
	In the first model trained, also blanks, multiple new lines and other 
	infrequent characters have been considered. It would be 
	interesting, in order to improve the performance, to apply a more thorough 
	preprocessing procedure to the texts and document the evolution of the 
	training loss function of the new model.
	\bigskip
	
	First of all, analysing the structure of the book, some parts of the text 
	were removed at the beginning and at the end that was not actually part of 
	the book (many of these were information concerning Project Gutenberg), and 
	the table of contents.
	
	After that, page breaks were removed from the text since they contain the 
	page number, in the format \verb/^\"[0-9]+m\"$/ that was going to increase 
	the frequency of numbers and of the letter \textit{m}.
	
	Finally, multiple new lines have been replaced with at most two, 
	corresponding to a new line followed by an empty line.
	
	Instead, were not taken into consideration the removal of punctuation, 
	since the purpose is to generate pretty looking sequences, therefore also 
	containing punctuation, as well as the removal of Greek letters, that does 
	not make difference since they appeared with rarely frequency (one sentence 
	in the whole text).
	\bigskip
	
	After the preprocessing, the book contains about 2.61 million characters 
	and $103$ unique characters. The character list is displayed in Figure 
	\ref{fig:preprocessed}.
	
	\begin{figure}[htb]

		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{preprocessed.png}	
		\caption{Unique characters in \textit{The Count of Monte Cristo} after 
		the preprocessing}
		\label{fig:preprocessed}

	Afterwards, analysing more carefully the frequencies of the characters, it 
	was decided to replace rare characters with the token `\texttt{UNK}'. In 
	particular, all those characters appearing with a frequency less than 
	100 have been considered "rare". In fact, in a text containing 2615988 
	occurrences, 100 are less than $0.004\%$.
	\bigskip
	
	Following, the two dictionaries containing the integer and integer mappings 
	have been recreated.

	The training loss of this experiment is shown in Figure 
	\ref{fig:loss-preprocessed}. At the end of the training, the loss is 
	1.24, so is decreased respect to the experiment without preprocessing.

	\noindent Below are shown some examples of sentences generated after the 
	training of this model:

	\end{shadequote}
	
	Also in this experiment, the sentences obtained have poor meaning, but the 
	percentage of existing English words is increase from $80\%$ to $86\%$.
	In this case, much less phrases generated contain multiple new lines.
	Moreover, most of the sentences include proper names such as 
	`\textit{mademoiselle de villefort}' and `\textit{monte cristo}' that comes 
	directly from the book.
	
	\bigskip
	
	One of the easiest thing that is possible to do to improve the results is 
	increasing the number of epochs of the training.
	\bigskip
	
	A new experiment was then carried out: the previous model has been trained 
	for 10 epochs instead of 5. The two trends of the losses are shown the 
	Figures \ref{fig:loss-preprocess-5and10epochs}.

	It is clearly visible that the training loss has continued to decrease in 
	the 
	following epochs, reaching 1.12. Table \ref{tab:performace-prepocess} 
	documents the training losses of the first experiment and of the ones with

	\end{shadequote}

	Also in this experiment, the sentences obtained are very similar to the 
	previous. 
	Sometimes it can be seen the attempt to generate sentences with a 
	more elaborate grammatical structure. Once again, there are some proper 
	names derived from the book.
	\bigskip
	
	The following experiment proposes the use of a model regularisation 
	technique, that is the addition of a dropout layer after 
	each LSTM cell. In particular, during the training phase, the probability 
	to keep each neuron is set to $0.5$, while during the generation of the 
	sentence is set to $1$.
	\bigskip
	
	The experiment with the dropout has been executed on the initial model and 
	on the one with preprocessing, in both cases for 5 training epochs. Another 
	experiment has been carried out on the experiment with preprocessing for 10 
	training epochs. 

	\bigskip
	In Table \ref{tab:performace-dropout} are summarised the training losses of 
	the  models presented above.

	Since the models seem to be underfitting, the following experiment aims is 
	to improve the model's performances by increasing the complexity of the 
	network, in particular, the number of parameters and in general the 
	dimension of the network. To accomplish this, a new LSTM cell is added to 
	the network after the previous, with the same number of hidden-units. 
	\bigskip
	
	The experiment with the additional layer has been executed on the 
	preprocessed model both with and without dropout. Since the results on the 
	model with dropouts are the worst, only those on the model without dropouts 
	will be shown. 
	\bigskip
	
	This experiment has been carried out for both 5 and 10 training epochs.
	\bigskip
	
	In Table \ref{tab:performace-layers} are summarised the training losses of 
	the  models presented above.

	The sentences generated with this experiment seems to have many more

	\bigskip
	The last experiment performed, used multiple books to train the network. In 
	particular, the books \textit{The Count of Monte Cristo}, \textit{The Three 
	Musketeers} and \textit{The Man In The Iron Mask}, which are all by the 
	same author, namely Alexandre Dumas, have been downloaded in plain English 
	text from Project Gutenberg.
	
	These books contain a total of 4.88 million characters and $104$ unique 
	characters. The character list is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:multibooks}.
